#!something
babel-rc needs to be set,
Install the babel packages @babel/core and @babel/preset which will convert ES6 to a commonjs target as node js doesn't understand ES6 targets directly.

npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/preset-env

Then you need to create one configuration file with name .babelrc in your project's root directory and add this code there

{ 
    "presets": ["@babel/preset-env"] 
}

This installation requirement may satisfy itself when you install typescript
